# Sticker Swap 

[Sticker Swap](https://stickerswap.io) is a website for sharing stickers. Earn sticker cred and swap stickers! 

## About 

Sticker Swap allows you and your friends from everywhere share stickers. The concept is similar to a sticker table at a conference where you can see which stickers are available and pick the ones you want. 

Sticker Swap works on the basis for Sticker Credits. If you share stickers, you'll get some credit. Each sticker has a Sticker Credit amount that the person sharing the sticker has decided on. You can spend your sticker credits to get stickers. 

If you want a sticker, just spend some sticker credits to request a sticker from another user. 

If you want to share a sticker, just post it on Sticker Swap. When someone wants your sticker, you can mail it to them. 

## Contributing

Sticker Swap is open-source. It's built on ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, Bootstrap and, Entity Framework. I'm always open to contributions.
